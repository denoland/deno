# Deno Language Server

The Deno Language Server provides a server implementation of the
[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
which is specifically tailored to provide a _Deno_ view of code. It is
integrated into the command line and can be started via the `lsp` sub-command.

This documentation has been moved to the
[Deno manual](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/advanced/language_server/overview).
