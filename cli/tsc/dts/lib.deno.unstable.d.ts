   * A key-value database that can be used to store and retrieve data.
   *
   * Data is stored as key-value pairs, where the key is a {@linkcode Deno.KvKey}
   * and the value is an arbitrary structured-serializable JavaScript value.
   * Keys are ordered lexicographically as described in the documentation for
   * {@linkcode Deno.KvKey}. Keys are unique within a database, and the last
   * value set for a given key is the one that is returned when reading the
   * key. Keys can be deleted from the database, in which case they will no
   * longer be returned when reading keys.
   *
   * Values can be any structured-serializable JavaScript value (objects,
   * arrays, strings, numbers, etc.). The special value {@linkcode Deno.KvU64}
   * can be used to store 64-bit unsigned integers in the database. This special
   * value can not be nested within other objects or arrays. In addition to the
   * regular database mutation operations, the unsigned 64-bit integer value
   * also supports `sum`, `max`, and `min` mutations.
   *
   * Keys are versioned on write by assigning the key an ever-increasing
   * "versionstamp". The versionstamp represents the version of a key-value pair
   * in the database at some point in time, and can be used to perform
   * transactional operations on the database without requiring any locking.
   * This is enabled by atomic operations, which can have conditions that ensure
   * that the operation only succeeds if the versionstamp of the key-value pair
   * matches an expected versionstamp.
   *
   * Keys have a maximum length of 2048 bytes after serialization. Values have a
   * maximum length of 64 KiB after serialization. Serialization of both keys
   * and values is somewhat opaque, but one can usually assume that the
   * serialization of any value is about the same length as the resulting string
   * of a JSON serialization of that same value. If theses limits are exceeded,
   * an exception will be thrown.
