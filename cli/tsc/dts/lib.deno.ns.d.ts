   * TLS CA certificates and connect via a proxy while using `fetch()`.
   *
   * The `cert` and `key` options can be used to specify a client certificate
   * and key to use when connecting to a server that requires client
   * authentication (mutual TLS or mTLS). The `cert` and `key` options must be
   * provided in PEM format.
   *
   * @example ```ts
   * const caCert = await Deno.readTextFile("./ca.pem");
   * const client = Deno.createHttpClient({ caCerts: [ caCert ] });
   * const response = await fetch("https://myserver.com", { client });
   * ```
   *
   * @example ```ts
   * const client = Deno.createHttpClient({
   *   proxy: { url: "http://myproxy.com:8080" }
   * });
   * const response = await fetch("https://myserver.com", { client });
   * ```
   *
   * @example ```ts
   * const key = "----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----...";
   * const cert = "----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----...";
   * const client = Deno.createHttpClient({ key, cert });
   * const response = await fetch("https://myserver.com", { client });
   * ```
