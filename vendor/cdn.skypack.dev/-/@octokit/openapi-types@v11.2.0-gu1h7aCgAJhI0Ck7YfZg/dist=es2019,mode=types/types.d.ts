     *
     * You can delete one analysis at a time.
     * To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.

     *
     * When you list the analyses for a repository,
     * one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
     *
     * ```
     * "deletable": true
     * ```
     *
     * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
     * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
     * for each enabled code scanning tool,
     * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
     *
     * * `ref`
     * * `tool`
     * * `analysis_key`
     * * `environment`
     *
     * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
     * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
     *
     * ```
     * Analysis specified is not deletable.
     * ```
     *
     * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
     * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set
     * (see the example default response below).
     * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
     * in the set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
     * for the specified tool in your repository.
     * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
     * When you delete the last analysis in a set the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
     * in the 200 response is `null`.
     *
     * As an example of the deletion process,
     * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
     * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
     * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
     * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
     * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
     * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
     * To start, you must find the deletable analysis for one of the sets,
     * step through deleting the analyses in that set,
     * and then repeat the process for the second set.
     * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
     *
     * **Outer loop**:
     * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
     * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
     *
     *   **Inner loop**:
     *   * Delete the identified analysis.
     *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
     *
     * The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

     * | ---- | ---- | ----------- |

     * the submodule at that specific commit.
     *
     * If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the
     * github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.

     * The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
     * before we merge a pull request.
     *
     * The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
     * multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
     * makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
     *
     * The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
     * the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
     * the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will

     * field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
     *
     * The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
     * be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
     * application with debugging enabled.

     * *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
     * *   There are no merge conflicts

     * This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
     * be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.
     *
     * #### Failed commit status checks
     * This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
     * status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

     * **Import status**
     *
     * This section includes details about the possible values of the `status` field of the Import Progress response.
     *
     * An import that does not have errors will progress through these steps:
     *
     * *   `detecting` - the "detection" step of the import is in progress because the request did not include a `vcs` parameter. The import is identifying the type of source control present at the URL.
     * *   `importing` - the "raw" step of the import is in progress. This is where commit data is fetched from the original repository. The import progress response will include `commit_count` (the total number of raw commits that will be imported) and `percent` (0 - 100, the current progress through the import).
     * *   `mapping` - the "rewrite" step of the import is in progress. This is where SVN branches are converted to Git branches, and where author updates are applied. The import progress response does not include progress information.
     * *   `pushing` - the "push" step of the import is in progress. This is where the importer updates the repository on GitHub. The import progress response will include `push_percent`, which is the percent value reported by `git push` when it is "Writing objects".
     * *   `complete` - the import is complete, and the repository is ready on GitHub.
     *
     * If there are problems, you will see one of these in the `status` field:
     *
     * *   `auth_failed` - the import requires authentication in order to connect to the original repository. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.
     * *   `error` - the import encountered an error. The import progress response will include the `failed_step` and an error message. Contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api) for more information.
     * *   `detection_needs_auth` - the importer requires authentication for the originating repository to continue detection. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.
     * *   `detection_found_nothing` - the importer didn't recognize any source control at the URL. To resolve, [Cancel the import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#cancel-an-import) and [retry](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#start-an-import) with the correct URL.
     * *   `detection_found_multiple` - the importer found several projects or repositories at the provided URL. When this is the case, the Import Progress response will also include a `project_choices` field with the possible project choices as values. To update project choice, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.
     *
     * **The project_choices field**
     *
     * When multiple projects are found at the provided URL, the response hash will include a `project_choices` field, the value of which is an array of hashes each representing a project choice. The exact key/value pairs of the project hashes will differ depending on the version control type.
     *
     * **Git LFS related fields**
     *
     * This section includes details about Git LFS related fields that may be present in the Import Progress response.
     *
     * *   `use_lfs` - describes whether the import has been opted in or out of using Git LFS. The value can be `opt_in`, `opt_out`, or `undecided` if no action has been taken.
     * *   `has_large_files` - the boolean value describing whether files larger than 100MB were found during the `importing` step.
     * *   `large_files_size` - the total size in gigabytes of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository.
     * *   `large_files_count` - the total number of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository. To see a list of these files, make a "Get Large Files" request.

     * #### Considerations for code search
     *
     * Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
     *
     * *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.
     * *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
     * *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing
     * language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.

     * Find commits via various criteria on the default branch (usually `master`). This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#pagination).
     *
     * When searching for commits, you can get text match metadata for the **message** field when you provide the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match
     * metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).
     *
     * For example, if you want to find commits related to CSS in the [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository. Your query would look something like this:
     *
     * `q=repo:octocat/Spoon-Knife+css`

     * search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).

   *
   * Encrypt your secret using the [tweetsodium](https://github.com/github/tweetsodium) library.
   *
   * ```
   * const sodium = require('/error/unknown:tweetsodium?from=@octokit/openapi-types');
   *
   * const key = "base64-encoded-public-key";
   * const value = "plain-text-secret";
   *
   * // Convert the message and key to Uint8Array's (Buffer implements that interface)
   * const messageBytes = Buffer.from(value);
   * const keyBytes = Buffer.from(key, 'base64');
   *
   * // Encrypt using LibSodium.
   * const encryptedBytes = sodium.seal(messageBytes, keyBytes);
   *
   * // Base64 the encrypted secret
   * const encrypted = Buffer.from(encryptedBytes).toString('base64');
   *
   * console.log(encrypted);
   * ```
   *
   *
   * #### Example encrypting a secret using Python
   *
   * Encrypt your secret using [pynacl](https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public/#nacl-public-sealedbox) with Python 3.
   *
   * ```
   * from base64 import b64encode
   * from nacl import encoding, public
   *
   * def encrypt(public_key: str, secret_value: str) -> str:
   *   """Encrypt a Unicode string using the public key."""
   *   public_key = public.PublicKey(public_key.encode("utf-8"), encoding.Base64Encoder())
   *   sealed_box = public.SealedBox(public_key)
   *   encrypted = sealed_box.encrypt(secret_value.encode("utf-8"))
   *   return b64encode(encrypted).decode("utf-8")
   * ```
   *
   * #### Example encrypting a secret using C#
   *
   * Encrypt your secret using the [Sodium.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sodium.Core/) package.
   *
   * ```
   * var secretValue = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("mySecret");
   * var publicKey = Convert.FromBase64String("2Sg8iYjAxxmI2LvUXpJjkYrMxURPc8r+dB7TJyvvcCU=");
   *
   * var sealedPublicKeyBox = Sodium.SealedPublicKeyBox.Create(secretValue, publicKey);
   *
   * Console.WriteLine(Convert.ToBase64String(sealedPublicKeyBox));
   * ```
   *
   * #### Example encrypting a secret using Ruby
   *
   * Encrypt your secret using the [rbnacl](https://github.com/RubyCrypto/rbnacl) gem.
   *
   * ```ruby
   * require "rbnacl"
   * require "base64"
   *
   * key = Base64.decode64("+ZYvJDZMHUfBkJdyq5Zm9SKqeuBQ4sj+6sfjlH4CgG0=")
   * public_key = RbNaCl::PublicKey.new(key)
   *
   * box = RbNaCl::Boxes::Sealed.from_public_key(public_key)
   * encrypted_secret = box.encrypt("my_secret")
   *
   * # Print the base64 encoded secret
   * puts Base64.strict_encode64(encrypted_secret)
   * ```

   * GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` write permission to use this endpoint.
   *
   * You can delete one analysis at a time.
   * To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.
   * Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
   *
   * When you list the analyses for a repository,
   * one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
   *
   * ```
   * "deletable": true
   * ```
   *
   * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
   * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
   * for each enabled code scanning tool,
   * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
   *
   * * `ref`
   * * `tool`
   * * `analysis_key`
   * * `environment`
   *
   * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
   * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
   *
   * ```
   * Analysis specified is not deletable.
   * ```
   *
   * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
   * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set
   * (see the example default response below).
   * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
   * in the set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
   * for the specified tool in your repository.
   * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
   * When you delete the last analysis in a set the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
   * in the 200 response is `null`.
   *
   * As an example of the deletion process,
   * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
   * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
   * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
   * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
   * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
   * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
   * To start, you must find the deletable analysis for one of the sets,
   * step through deleting the analyses in that set,
   * and then repeat the process for the second set.
   * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
   *
   * **Outer loop**:
   * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
   * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
   *
   *   **Inner loop**:
   *   * Delete the identified analysis.
   *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
   *
   * The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

   * **Note:** If there are more than 300 files in the commit diff, the response will include pagination link headers for the remaining files, up to a limit of 3000 files. Each page contains the static commit information, and the only changes are to the file listing.
   *
   * You can pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to  fetch `diff` and `patch` formats. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.
   *
   * To return only the SHA-1 hash of the commit reference, you can provide the `sha` custom [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) in the `Accept` header. You can use this endpoint to check if a remote reference's SHA-1 hash is the same as your local reference's SHA-1 hash by providing the local SHA-1 reference as the ETag.
   *
   * **Signature verification object**
   *
   * The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:
   *
   * | Name | Type | Description |
   * | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
   * | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
   * | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
   * | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
   * | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
   *
   * These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:
   *
   * | Value | Description |
   * | ----- | ----------- |
   * | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
   * | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
   * | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
   * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
   * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
   * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
   * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
   * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
   * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
   * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
   * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
   * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
   * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

For more information on working with pagination, see "[Traversing with pagination](/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination)."
   *
   * When calling this API without any paging parameters (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison. When a paging parameter is specified, the first commit in the returned list of each page is the earliest.

   * Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the file path or directory in `:path`. If you omit
   * `:path`, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory. See the description below regarding what the API response includes for directories.
   *
   * Files and symlinks support [a custom media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#custom-media-types) for
   * retrieving the raw content or rendered HTML (when supported). All content types support [a custom media
   * type](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#custom-media-types) to ensure the content is returned in a consistent
   * object format.
   *
   * **Note**:
   * *   To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#trees).
   * *   This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the [Git Trees
   * API](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#get-a-tree).
   * *   This API supports files up to 1 megabyte in size.
   *
   * #### If the content is a directory
   * The response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory.
   * When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value
   * _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists in API v3 [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW).
   * In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".
   *
   * #### If the content is a symlink
   * If the requested `:path` points to a symlink, and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the
   * API responds with the content of the file (in the format shown in the example. Otherwise, the API responds with an object
   * describing the symlink itself.
   *
   * #### If the content is a submodule
   * The `submodule_git_url` identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific
   * commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out
   * the submodule at that specific commit.
   *
   * If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the
   * github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.

  /**
   * Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.
   *
   * The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
   * before we merge a pull request.
   *
   * The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
   * multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
   * makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
   *
   * The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
   * the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
   * the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
   * return a failure response.
   *
   * By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
   * state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
   * specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
   * not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
   *
   * The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
   * field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
   *
   * The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
   * be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
   * application with debugging enabled.
   *
   * Users with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref.
   *
   * #### Merged branch response
   * You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
   * a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
   * *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
   * *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
   * *   There are no merge conflicts
   *
   * If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
   * response.
   *
   * #### Merge conflict response
   * This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
   * be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.
   *
   * #### Failed commit status checks
   * This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
   * status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

   * | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
   * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
   * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
   * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
   * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
   * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
   * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
   * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
   * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
   * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
   * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

  /**
   * View the progress of an import.
   *
   * **Import status**
   *
   * This section includes details about the possible values of the `status` field of the Import Progress response.
   *
   * An import that does not have errors will progress through these steps:
   *
   * *   `detecting` - the "detection" step of the import is in progress because the request did not include a `vcs` parameter. The import is identifying the type of source control present at the URL.
   * *   `importing` - the "raw" step of the import is in progress. This is where commit data is fetched from the original repository. The import progress response will include `commit_count` (the total number of raw commits that will be imported) and `percent` (0 - 100, the current progress through the import).
   * *   `mapping` - the "rewrite" step of the import is in progress. This is where SVN branches are converted to Git branches, and where author updates are applied. The import progress response does not include progress information.
   * *   `pushing` - the "push" step of the import is in progress. This is where the importer updates the repository on GitHub. The import progress response will include `push_percent`, which is the percent value reported by `git push` when it is "Writing objects".
   * *   `complete` - the import is complete, and the repository is ready on GitHub.
   *
   * If there are problems, you will see one of these in the `status` field:
   *
   * *   `auth_failed` - the import requires authentication in order to connect to the original repository. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.
   * *   `error` - the import encountered an error. The import progress response will include the `failed_step` and an error message. Contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api) for more information.
   * *   `detection_needs_auth` - the importer requires authentication for the originating repository to continue detection. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.
   * *   `detection_found_nothing` - the importer didn't recognize any source control at the URL. To resolve, [Cancel the import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#cancel-an-import) and [retry](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#start-an-import) with the correct URL.
   * *   `detection_found_multiple` - the importer found several projects or repositories at the provided URL. When this is the case, the Import Progress response will also include a `project_choices` field with the possible project choices as values. To update project choice, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.
   *
   * **The project_choices field**
   *
   * When multiple projects are found at the provided URL, the response hash will include a `project_choices` field, the value of which is an array of hashes each representing a project choice. The exact key/value pairs of the project hashes will differ depending on the version control type.
   *
   * **Git LFS related fields**
   *
   * This section includes details about Git LFS related fields that may be present in the Import Progress response.
   *
   * *   `use_lfs` - describes whether the import has been opted in or out of using Git LFS. The value can be `opt_in`, `opt_out`, or `undecided` if no action has been taken.
   * *   `has_large_files` - the boolean value describing whether files larger than 100MB were found during the `importing` step.
   * *   `large_files_size` - the total size in gigabytes of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository.
   * *   `large_files_count` - the total number of files larger than 100MB found in the originating repository. To see a list of these files, make a "Get Large Files" request.

   * When you get, [create](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls/#create-a-pull-request), or [edit](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls#update-a-pull-request) a pull request, GitHub creates a merge commit to test whether the pull request can be automatically merged into the base branch. This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the `mergeable` key. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".
   *
   * The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.
   *
   * The value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:
   *
   * *   If merged as a [merge commit](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.
   * *   If merged via a [squash](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch.
   * *   If [rebased](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.
   *

   * This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See "[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)" for details.
   *
   * Pull request reviews created in the `PENDING` state do not include the `submitted_at` property in the response.
   *
   * **Note:** To comment on a specific line in a file, you need to first determine the _position_ of that line in the diff. The GitHub REST API v3 offers the `application/vnd.github.v3.diff` [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests). To see a pull request diff, add this media type to the `Accept` header of a call to the [single pull request](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/pulls#get-a-pull-request) endpoint.
   *
   * The `position` value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@" hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.

   * This endpoint makes use of [a Hypermedia relation](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in
   * the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.
   *
   * You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.
   *
   * Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example:
   *
   * `application/zip`
   *
   * GitHub expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
   * you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.
   *
   * When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.
   *
   * **Notes:**
   * *   GitHub renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List assets for a release](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#list-assets-for-a-release)"
   * endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).
   * *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset.

   *
   * When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/search#text-match-metadata).
   *
   * For example, if you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) repository, your query would look something like this:

   * `q=addClass+in:file+language:js+repo:jquery/jquery`
   *
   * This query searches for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. The query limits the search to files where the language is JavaScript in the `jquery/jquery` repository.
   *
   * #### Considerations for code search
   *
   * Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:
   *
   * *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.
   * *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable.
   * *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing
   * language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.

  /**
   * **Deprecated**: Use `repos.compareCommitsWithBasehead()` (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/{basehead}`) instead. Both `:base` and `:head` must be branch names in `:repo`. To compare branches across other repositories in the same network as `:repo`, use the format `<USERNAME>:branch`.
   *
   * The response from the API is equivalent to running the `git log base..head` command; however, commits are returned in chronological order. Pass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats.
   *
   * The response also includes details on the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (for example, if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.
   *
   * **Working with large comparisons**
   *
   * To process a response with a large number of commits, you can use (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using paging, the list of changed files is only returned with page 1, but includes all changed files for the entire comparison. For more information on working with pagination, see "[Traversing with pagination](/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination)."
   *
   * When calling this API without any paging parameters (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison. When a paging parameter is specified, the first commit in the returned list of each page is the earliest.
   *
   * **Signature verification object**
   *
   * The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:
   *
   * | Name | Type | Description |
   * | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
   * | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
   * | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
   * | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
   * | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
   *
   * These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:
   *
   * | Value | Description |
   * | ----- | ----------- |
   * | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
   * | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
   * | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
   * | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
   * | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
   * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
   * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
   * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
   * | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
   * | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
   * | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
   * | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
   * | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |
