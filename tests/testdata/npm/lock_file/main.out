error: Integrity check failed for package: "npm:@babel/parser@7.19.0". Unable to verify that the package
is the same as when the lockfile was generated.

Actual: sha512-74bEXKX2h+8rrfQUfsBfuZZHzsEs6Eql4pqy/T4Nn6Y9wNPggQOqD6z6pn5Bl8ZfysKouFZT/UXEH94ummEeQw==
Expected: sha512-foobar!

This could be caused by:
  * the lock file may be corrupt
  * the source itself may be corrupt

Use the --lock-write flag to regenerate the lockfile at "[WILDCARD]lock.json".
