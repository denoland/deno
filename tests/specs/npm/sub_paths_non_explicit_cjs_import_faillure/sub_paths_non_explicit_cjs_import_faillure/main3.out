error: Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Unable to load [WILDCARD]server imported from [WILDCARD]main3.js
  Caused by:
[WILDCARD]
const Server = await import("npm:@denotest/cjs-non-explicit-file@1.0.0/server");

    info: The module that you are trying to import seems to be a CommonJS.
          However it is not listed in the exports of package.json.
          So it cannot be statically resolved when imported from ESM.
          Consider to include an extension of the module.
    hint: Did you mean to import "npm:@denotest/cjs-non-explicit-file@1.0.0/server.js"?
