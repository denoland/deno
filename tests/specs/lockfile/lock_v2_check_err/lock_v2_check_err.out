[WILDCARD]Integrity check failed for remote specifier. The source code is invalid, as it does not match the expected hash in the lock file.

  Specifier: http://127.0.0.1:4545/run/003_relative_import.ts
  Actual: a1572e8fd2c2712b33f04aed2561505b5feb2c8696f1f2cded3de7127931b97e
  Expected: bad

This could be caused by:
  * the lock file may be corrupt
  * the source itself may be corrupt

Use the --lock-write flag to regenerate the lockfile or --reload to reload the source code from the server.
