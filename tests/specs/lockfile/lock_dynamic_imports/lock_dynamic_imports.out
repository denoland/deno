error: Integrity check failed for remote specifier. The source code is invalid, as it does not match the expected hash in the lock file.

  Specifier: http://127.0.0.1:4545/subdir/subdir2/mod2.ts
  Actual: 8b3b670d25d238dfa72df119140406b96766a00fee635f3606429fe065b18fd1
  Expected: bad

This could be caused by:
  * the lock file may be corrupt
  * the source itself may be corrupt

Investigate the lockfile; delete it to regenerate the lockfile or --reload to reload the source code from the server.
