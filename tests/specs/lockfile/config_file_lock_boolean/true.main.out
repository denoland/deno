[WILDCARD]Integrity check failed for remote specifier. The source code is invalid, as it does not match the expected hash in the lock file.

  Specifier: http://localhost:4545/subdir/print_hello.ts
  Actual: fa6692c8f9ff3fb107e773c3ece5274e9d08be282867a1e3ded1d9c00fcaa63c
  Expected: foobar

This could be caused by:
  * the lock file may be corrupt
  * the source itself may be corrupt

Investigate the lockfile; delete it to regenerate the lockfile or --reload to reload the source code from the server.
