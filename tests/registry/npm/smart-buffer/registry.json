 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JoshGlazebrook/smart-buffer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JoshGlazebrook/smart-buffer)  [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/JoshGlazebrook/smart-buffer/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/JoshGlazebrook/smart-buffer?branch=master)\n=============\n\nsmart-buffer is a Buffer wrapper that adds automatic read & write offset tracking, string operations, data insertions, and more.\n\n![stats](https://nodei.co/npm/smart-buffer.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true \"stats\")\n\n**Key Features**:\n* Proxies all of the Buffer write and read functions\n* Keeps track of read and write offsets automatically\n* Grows the internal Buffer as needed\n* Useful string operations. (Null terminating strings)\n* Allows for inserting values at specific points in the Buffer\n* Built in TypeScript\n* Type Definitions Provided\n* Browser Support (using Webpack/Browserify)\n* Full test coverage\n\n**Requirements**:\n* Node v4.0+ is supported at this time.  (Versions prior to 2.0 will work on node 0.10)\n\n\n\n## Breaking Changes in v4.0\n\n* Old constructor patterns have been completely removed. It's now required to use the SmartBuffer.fromXXX() factory constructors.\n* rewind(), skip(), moveTo() have been removed. (see [offsets](#offsets))\n* Internal private properties are now prefixed with underscores (_)\n* **All** writeXXX() methods that are given an offset will now **overwrite data** instead of insert. (see [write vs insert](#write-vs-insert))\n* insertXXX() methods have been added for when you want to insert data at a specific offset (this replaces the old behavior of writeXXX() when an offset was provided)\n\n\n## Looking for v3 docs?\n\nLegacy documentation for version 3 and prior can be found [here](https://github.com/JoshGlazebrook/smart-buffer/blob/master/docs/README_v3.md).\n\n## Installing:\n\n`yarn add smart-buffer`\n\nor\n\n`npm install smart-buffer`\n\nNote: The published NPM package includes the built javascript library.\nIf you cloned this repo and wish to build the library manually use:\n\n`npm run build`\n\n## Using smart-buffer\n\n```javascript\n// Javascript\nconst SmartBuffer = require('smart-buffer').SmartBuffer;\n\n// Typescript\nimport { SmartBuffer, SmartBufferOptions} from 'smart-buffer';\n```\n\n### Simple Example\n\nBuilding a packet that uses the following protocol specification:\n\n`[PacketType:2][PacketLength:2][Data:XX]`\n\nTo build this packet using the vanilla Buffer class, you would have to count up the length of the data payload beforehand. You would also need to keep track of the current \"cursor\" position in your Buffer so you write everything in the right places. With smart-buffer you don't have to do either of those things.\n\n```javascript\nfunction createLoginPacket(username, password, age, country) {\n    const packet = new SmartBuffer();\n    packet.writeUInt16LE(0x0060); // Some packet type\n    packet.writeStringNT(username);\n    packet.writeStringNT(password);\n    packet.writeUInt8(age);\n    packet.writeStringNT(country);\n    packet.insertUInt16LE(packet.length - 2, 2);\n\n    return packet.toBuffer();\n}\n```\nWith the above function, you now can do this:\n```javascript\nconst login = createLoginPacket(\"Josh\", \"secret123\", 22, \"United States\");\n\n// <Buffer 60 00 1e 00 4a 6f 73 68 00 73 65 63 72 65 74 31 32 33 00 16 55 6e 69 74 65 64 20 53 74 61 74 65 73 00>\n```\nNotice that the `[PacketLength:2]` value (1e 00) was inserted at position 2.\n\nReading back the packet we created above is just as easy:\n```javascript\n\nconst reader = SmartBuffer.fromBuffer(login);\n\nconst logininfo = {\n    packetType: reader.readUInt16LE(),\n    packetLength: reader.readUInt16LE(),\n    username: reader.readStringNT(),\n    password: reader.readStringNT(),\n    age: reader.readUInt8(),\n    country: reader.readStringNT()\n};\n\n/*\n{\n    packetType: 96, (0x0060)\n    packetLength: 30,\n    username: 'Josh',\n    password: 'secret123',\n    age: 22,\n    country: 'United States'\n}\n*/\n```\n\n\n## Write vs Insert\nIn prior versions of SmartBuffer, .writeXXX(value, offset) calls would insert data when an offset was provided. In version 4, this will now overwrite the data at the offset position. To insert data there are now corresponding .insertXXX(value, offset) methods.\n\n**SmartBuffer v3**:\n```javascript\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromBuffer(new Buffer([1,2,3,4,5,6]));\nbuff.writeInt8(7, 2);\nconsole.log(buff.toBuffer())\n\n// <Buffer 01 02 07 03 04 05 06>\n```\n\n**SmartBuffer v4**:\n```javascript\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromBuffer(new Buffer([1,2,3,4,5,6]));\nbuff.writeInt8(7, 2);\nconsole.log(buff.toBuffer());\n\n// <Buffer 01 02 07 04 05 06>\n```\n\nTo insert you instead should use:\n```javascript\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromBuffer(new Buffer([1,2,3,4,5,6]));\nbuff.insertInt8(7, 2);\nconsole.log(buff.toBuffer());\n\n// <Buffer 01 02 07 03 04 05 06>\n```\n\n**Note:** Insert/Writing to a position beyond the currently tracked internal Buffer will zero pad to your offset.\n\n## Constructing a smart-buffer\n\nThere are a few different ways to construct a SmartBuffer instance.\n\n```javascript\n// Creating SmartBuffer from existing Buffer\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromBuffer(buffer); // Creates instance from buffer. (Uses default utf8 encoding)\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromBuffer(buffer, 'ascii'); // Creates instance from buffer with ascii encoding for strings.\n\n// Creating SmartBuffer with specified internal Buffer size. (Note: this is not a hard cap, the internal buffer will grow as needed).\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromSize(1024); // Creates instance with internal Buffer size of 1024.\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromSize(1024, 'utf8'); // Creates instance with internal Buffer size of 1024, and utf8 encoding for strings.\n\n// Creating SmartBuffer with options object. This one specifies size and encoding.\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromOptions({\n    size: 1024,\n    encoding: 'ascii'\n});\n\n// Creating SmartBuffer with options object. This one specified an existing Buffer.\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromOptions({\n    buff: buffer\n});\n\n// Creating SmartBuffer from a string.\nconst buff = SmartBuffer.fromBuffer(Buffer.from('some string', 'utf8'));\n\n// Just want a regular SmartBuffer with all default options?\nconst buff = new SmartBuffer();\n```\n\n# Api Reference:\n\n**Note:** SmartBuffer is fully documented with Typescript definitions as well as jsdocs so your favorite editor/IDE will have intellisense.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n1.
