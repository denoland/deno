# Typescript-Go Integration

Currently only integrated with deno check, though in the future it will also be
integrated with our LSP implementation.

In the CLI, we have a small abstraction over the tsc backend in
[cli/tsc/mod.rs](../cli/tsc/mod.rs). Along with some shared types and
functionality, the main piece is the `exec` function, which takes a "request" to
be served by the typescript compiler and returns the result. This now has two
different "backend" which can serve the request â€“ the current tsc, which runs in
an isolate and communicates via ops, and typescript-go which runs in a
subprocess and uses IPC.

From a high level, the way the tsgo backend works is that we download a
typescript-go binary from
[github releases](https://github.com/denoland/typescript-go/releases) into the
deno cache dir. To actually interface with tsgo, we spawn it in a subprocess and
write messages over stdin/stdout (similar to the Language Server Protocol). The
format is a mixture of binary data (for the header and other protocol level
details) followed by json encoded values for RPC calls. The rust implementation
of the IPC protocol is in the
[deno_typescript_go_client_rust crate](../libs/typescript_go_client/src/lib.rs).

We currently maintain a
[fork of typescript-go](https://github.com/denoland/typescript-go) with the
following changes:

- Special handling of the global symbol tables to account for the fact that we
  have two slightly different sets of globals: one for node contexts (in npm
  packages), and one for deno contexts. At this point, the main difference is
  the type returned by `setTimeout`. With node globals `setTimeout` returns an
  object, and with deno globals it returns a number (just like the web
  standard).
- Symbol table logic to prevent @types/node from creating type errors by
  introducing incompatible definitions for globals
- Additional hooks to allow us to provide our own resolution, determine whether
  a file is esm/cjs, etc.
- Additional APIs exposed from the IPC server
- Support for deno's custom libs (`deno.window`, `deno.worker`, etc)
