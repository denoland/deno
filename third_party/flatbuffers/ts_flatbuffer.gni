# Compile a flatbuffer to typescript.
#
#   flatc_include_dirs (optional)
#       Specifies the directories which FlatBuffers compiler uses to find
#       included .fbs files in. Almost always should be empty.
#
#       The list always has an implicit first item corresponding to the root of
#       the source tree. This enables including .fbs files by absolute path.
#
#       The compiler will try the directories in the order given, and if all
#       fail it will try to load relative to the directory of the schema file
#       being parsed.
#
#   deps (optional)
#       Additional dependencies.
#
# Example:
#  ts_flatbuffer("foo_ts") {
#    sources = [
#      "foo.fbs",
#    ]
#  }
