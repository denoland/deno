# Compile a flatbuffer.
#
#   flatc_out_dir (optional)
#       Specifies the path suffix that output files are generated under. This
#       path will be appended to root_gen_dir.
#
#       Targets that depend on the flatbuffer target will be able to include
#       the resulting FlatBuffers header with an include like:
#         #include "dir/for/my_flatbuffer/buffer_generated.h"
#       If undefined, this defaults to matchign the input directory for each
#       .fbs file (you should almost always use the default mode).
#
#   flatc_include_dirs (optional)
#       Specifies the directories which FlatBuffers compiler uses to find
#       included .fbs files in. Almost always should be empty.
#
#       The list always has an implicit first item corresponding to the root of
#       the source tree. This enables including .fbs files by absolute path.
#
#       The compiler will try the directories in the order given, and if all
#       fail it will try to load relative to the directory of the schema file
#       being parsed.
#
#   deps (optional)
#       Additional dependencies.
#
# Parameters for compiling the generated code:
#
#   defines (optional)
#       Defines to supply to the source set that compiles the generated source
#       code.
#
#   extra_configs (optional)
#       A list of config labels that will be appended to the configs applying
#       to the source set.
#
#   testonly (optional)
#       Boolean to indicate whether the generated source sets should be labeled
#       as testonly.
#
# Example:
#  flatbuffer("mylib") {
#    sources = [
#      "foo.fbs",
#    ]
#  }
