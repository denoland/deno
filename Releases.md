### v0.2.0 / 2018.11.27 / Mildly usable

[An intro talk was recorded.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlTG0UXRAkE)

Stability and usability improvements. `fetch()` is 90% functional now. Basic
REPL support was added. Shebang support was added. Command-line argument parsing
was improved. A forwarding service `https://deno.land/x` was set up for Deno
code. Example code has been posted to
[deno.land/x/examples](https://github.com/denoland/deno_examples) and
[deno.land/x/net](https://github.com/denoland/net).

The resources table was added to abstract various types of I/O streams and other
allocated state. A resource is an integer identifier which maps to some Rust
object. It can be used with various ops, particularly read and write.

### v0.1.8 / 2018.10.12 / Connecting to Tokio / Fleshing out APIs

Most file system ops were implemented. Basic TCP networking is implemented.
Basic stdio streams exposed. And many random OS facilities were exposed (e.g.
environmental variables)

Tokio was chosen as the backing event loop library. A careful mapping of JS
Promises onto Rust Futures was made, preserving error handling and the ability
to execute synchronously in the main thread.

Continuous benchmarks were added: https://denoland.github.io/deno/ Performance
issues are beginning to be addressed.

"deno --types" was added to reference runtime APIs.

Working towards https://github.com/denoland/deno/milestone/2 We expect v0.2 to
be released in last October or early November.

### v0.1.3 / 2018.09.05 / Scale binding infrastructure

ETA v.0.2 October 2018 https://github.com/denoland/deno/milestone/2

We decided to use Tokio https://tokio.rs/ to provide asynchronous I/O, thread
pool execution, and as a base for high level support for various internet
protocols like HTTP. Tokio is strongly designed around the idea of Futures -
which map quite well onto JavaScript promises. We want to make it as easy as
possible to start a Tokio future from JavaScript and get a Promise for handling
it. We expect this to result in preliminary file system operations, fetch() for
http. Additionally we are working on CI, release, and benchmarking
infrastructure to scale development.

Changes since v0.1.2:

- Fixes module resolution error #645
- Better flag parsing
- lStatSync -> lstatSync
- Added deno.renameSync()
- Added deno.mkdirSync()
- Fix circular dependencies #653
- Added deno.env() and --allow-env

### v0.1.2 / 2018.08.30

- Added https import support.
- Added deno.makeTempDirSync().
- Added deno.lstatSync() and deno.statSync().

### v0.1.1 / 2018.08.27

### v0.1.0 / 2018.08.23 / Rust rewrite and V8 snapshot

Complete! https://github.com/denoland/deno/milestone/1

Go is a garbage collected language and we are worried that combining it with
V8's GC will lead to difficult contention problems down the road.

The V8Worker2 binding/concept is being ported to a new C++ library called
libdeno. libdeno will include the entire JS runtime as a V8 snapshot. It still
follows the message passing paradigm. Rust will be bound to this library to
implement the privileged part of deno. See deno2/README.md for more details.

V8 Snapshots allow deno to avoid recompiling the TypeScript compiler at startup.
This is already working.

When the rewrite is at feature parity with the Go prototype, we will release
binaries for people to try.
