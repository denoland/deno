# Node.js Adapter for Hono

This adapter `@hono/node-server` allows you to run your Hono application on Node.js.
Initially, Hono wasn't designed for Node.js, but with this adapter, you can now use Hono on Node.js.
It utilizes web standard APIs implemented in Node.js version 18 or higher.

## Benchmarks

Hono is 3.5 times faster than Express.

Express:

```txt
$ bombardier -d 10s --fasthttp http://localhost:3000/

Statistics        Avg      Stdev        Max
  Reqs/sec     16438.94    1603.39   19155.47
  Latency        7.60ms     7.51ms   559.89ms
  HTTP codes:
    1xx - 0, 2xx - 164494, 3xx - 0, 4xx - 0, 5xx - 0
    others - 0
  Throughput:     4.55MB/s
```

Hono + `@hono/node-server`:

```txt
$ bombardier -d 10s --fasthttp http://localhost:3000/

Statistics        Avg      Stdev        Max
  Reqs/sec     58296.56    5512.74   74403.56
  Latency        2.14ms     1.46ms   190.92ms
  HTTP codes:
    1xx - 0, 2xx - 583059, 3xx - 0, 4xx - 0, 5xx - 0
    others - 0
  Throughput:    12.56MB/s
```

## Requirements

It works on Node.js versions greater than 18.x. The specific required Node.js versions are as follows:

- 18.x => 18.14.1+
- 19.x => 19.7.0+
- 20.x => 20.0.0+

Essentially, you can simply use the latest version of each major release.

## Installation

You can install it from the npm registry with `npm` command:

```sh
npm install @hono/node-server
```

Or use `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add @hono/node-server
```

## Usage

Just import `@hono/node-server` at the top and write the code as usual.
The same code that runs on Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and Bun will work.

```ts
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server'
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono()
app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hono meets Node.js'))

serve(app, (info) => {
  console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${info.port}`) // Listening on http://localhost:3000
})
```

For example, run it using `ts-node`. Then an HTTP server will be launched. The default port is `3000`.

```sh
ts-node ./index.ts
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser.

## Options

### `port`

```ts
serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port: 8787, // Port number, default is 3000
})
```

### `createServer`

```ts
import { createServer } from 'node:https'
import fs from 'node:fs'

//...

serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  createServer: createServer,
  serverOptions: {
    key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent1-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent1-cert.pem'),
  },
})
```

### `overrideGlobalObjects`

The default value is `true`. The Node.js Adapter rewrites the global Request/Response and uses a lightweight Request/Response to improve performance. If you don't want to do that, set `false`.

```ts
serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  overrideGlobalObjects: false,
})
```

### `autoCleanupIncoming`

The default value is `true`. The Node.js Adapter automatically cleans up (explicitly call `destroy()` method) if application is not finished to consume the incoming request. If you don't want to do that, set `false`.

If the application accepts connections from arbitrary clients, this cleanup must be done otherwise incomplete requests from clients may cause the application to stop responding. If your application only accepts connections from trusted clients, such as in a reverse proxy environment and there is no process that returns a response without reading the body of the POST request all the way through, you can improve performance by setting it to `false`.

```ts
serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  autoCleanupIncoming: false,
})
```

## Middleware

Most built-in middleware also works with Node.js.
Read [the documentation](https://hono.dev/middleware/builtin/basic-auth) and use the Middleware of your liking.

```ts
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server'
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { prettyJSON } from 'hono/pretty-json'

const app = new Hono()

app.get('*', prettyJSON())
app.get('/', (c) => c.json({ 'Hono meets': 'Node.js' }))

serve(app)
```

## Serve Static Middleware

Use Serve Static Middleware that has been created for Node.js.

```ts
import { serveStatic } from '@hono/node-server/serve-static'

//...

app.use('/static/*', serveStatic({ root: './' }))
```

If using a relative path, `root` will be relative to the current working directory from which the app was started.

This can cause confusion when running your application locally.

Imagine your project structure is:

```
my-hono-project/
  src/
    index.ts
  static/
    index.html
```

Typically, you would run your app from the project's root directory (`my-hono-project`),
so you would need the following code to serve the `static` folder:

```ts
app.use('/static/*', serveStatic({ root: './static' }))
```

Notice that `root` here is not relative to `src/index.ts`, rather to `my-hono-project`.

### Options

#### `rewriteRequestPath`

If you want to serve files in `./.foojs` with the request path `/__foo/*`, you can write like the following.

```ts
app.use(
  '/__foo/*',
  serveStatic({
    root: './.foojs/',
    rewriteRequestPath: (path: string) => path.replace(/^\/__foo/, ''),
  })
)
```

#### `onFound`

You can specify handling when the requested file is found with `onFound`.

```ts
app.use(
  '/static/*',
  serveStatic({
    // ...
    onFound: (_path, c) => {
      c.header('Cache-Control', `public, immutable, max-age=31536000`)
    },
  })
)
```

#### `onNotFound`

The `onNotFound` is useful for debugging. You can write a handle for when a file is not found.

```ts
app.use(
  '/static/*',
  serveStatic({
    root: './non-existent-dir',
    onNotFound: (path, c) => {
      console.log(`${path} is not found, request to ${c.req.path}`)
    },
  })
)
```

#### `precompressed`

The `precompressed` option checks if files with extensions like `.br` or `.gz` are available and serves them based on the `Accept-Encoding` header. It prioritizes Brotli, then Zstd, and Gzip. If none are available, it serves the original file.

```ts
app.use(
  '/static/*',
  serveStatic({
    precompressed: true,
  })
)
```

## ConnInfo Helper

You can use the [ConnInfo Helper](https://hono.dev/docs/helpers/conninfo) by importing `getConnInfo` from `@hono/node-server/conninfo`.

```ts
import { getConnInfo } from '@hono/node-server/conninfo'

app.get('/', (c) => {
  const info = getConnInfo(c) // info is `ConnInfo`
  return c.text(`Your remote address is ${info.remote.address}`)
})
```

## Accessing Node.js API

You can access the Node.js API from `c.env` in Node.js. For example, if you want to specify a type, you can write the following.

```ts
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server'
import type { HttpBindings } from '@hono/node-server'
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: HttpBindings }>()

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.json({
    remoteAddress: c.env.incoming.socket.remoteAddress,
  })
})

serve(app)
```

The APIs that you can get from `c.env` are as follows.

```ts
type HttpBindings = {
  incoming: IncomingMessage
  outgoing: ServerResponse
}

type Http2Bindings = {
  incoming: Http2ServerRequest
  outgoing: Http2ServerResponse
}
```

## Direct response from Node.js API

You can directly respond to the client from the Node.js API.
In that case, the response from Hono should be ignored, so return `RESPONSE_ALREADY_SENT`.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature can be used when migrating existing Node.js applications to Hono, but we recommend using Hono's API for new applications.

```ts
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server'
import type { HttpBindings } from '@hono/node-server'
import { RESPONSE_ALREADY_SENT } from '@hono/node-server/utils/response'
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const app = new Hono<{ Bindings: HttpBindings }>()

app.get('/', (c) => {
  const { outgoing } = c.env
  outgoing.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
  outgoing.end('Hello World\n')

  return RESPONSE_ALREADY_SENT
})

serve(app)
```

## Listen to a UNIX domain socket

You can configure the HTTP server to listen to a UNIX domain socket instead of a TCP port.

```ts
import { createAdaptorServer } from '@hono/node-server'

// ...

const socketPath ='/tmp/example.sock'

const server = createAdaptorServer(app)
server.listen(socketPath, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on ${socketPath}`)
})
```

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
