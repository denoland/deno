 * [TestConfig](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig), in which case they are shared between all projects.

   * ```
   *
   * **Details**
   *
   * The value might include some "tokens" that will be replaced with actual values during test execution.
   *
   * Consider the following file structure:
   *
   * ```txt
   * playwright.config.ts
   * tests/
   * └── page/
   *     └── page-click.spec.ts
   * ```

   * // page-click.spec.ts
   * import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
   *
   * test.describe('suite', () => {

   *     await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(['foo', 'bar', 'baz.png']);
   *   });
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * The list of supported tokens:
   * - `{arg}` - Relative snapshot path **without extension**. This comes from the arguments passed to
   *   `toHaveScreenshot()`, `toMatchAriaSnapshot()` or `toMatchSnapshot()`; if called without arguments, this will be
   *   an auto-generated snapshot name.
   *   - Value: `foo/bar/baz`
   * - `{ext}` - Snapshot extension (with the leading dot).
   *   - Value: `.png`
   * - `{platform}` - The value of `process.platform`.
   * - `{projectName}` - Project's file-system-sanitized name, if any.
   *   - Value: `''` (empty string).
   * - `{snapshotDir}` - Project's
   *   [testProject.snapshotDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-snapshot-dir).
   *   - Value: `/home/playwright/tests` (since `snapshotDir` is not provided in config, it defaults to `testDir`)
   * - `{testDir}` - Project's
   *   [testProject.testDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject#test-project-test-dir).
   *   - Value: `/home/playwright/tests` (absolute path since `testDir` is resolved relative to directory with
   *     config)
   * - `{testFileDir}` - Directories in relative path from `testDir` to **test file**.
   *   - Value: `page`
   * - `{testFileName}` - Test file name with extension.
   *   - Value: `page-click.spec.ts`
   * - `{testFilePath}` - Relative path from `testDir` to **test file**.
   *   - Value: `page/page-click.spec.ts`
   * - `{testName}` - File-system-sanitized test title, including parent describes but excluding file name.
   *   - Value: `suite-test-should-work`
   *
   * Each token can be preceded with a single character that will be used **only if** this token has non-empty value.
   *
   * Consider the following config:
   *
   * ```js
   * // playwright.config.ts
   * import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
   *
   * export default defineConfig({
   *   snapshotPathTemplate: '__screenshots__{/projectName}/{testFilePath}/{arg}{ext}',

   *     { name: 'chromium', use: { browserName: 'chromium' } },
   *   ],
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * In this config:
   * 1. First project **does not** have a name, so its snapshots will be stored in
   *    `<configDir>/__screenshots__/example.spec.ts/...`.
   * 1. Second project **does** have a name, so its snapshots will be stored in
   *    `<configDir>/__screenshots__/chromium/example.spec.ts/..`.
   * 1. Since `snapshotPathTemplate` resolves to relative path, it will be resolved relative to `configDir`.
   * 1. Forward slashes `"/"` can be used as path separators on any platform.

   * Launch a development web server (or multiple) during the tests.
   *
   * **Details**
   *
   * If the port is specified, Playwright Test will wait for it to be available on `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, before running
   * the tests. If the url is specified, Playwright Test will wait for the URL to return a 2xx, 3xx, 400, 401, 402, or
   * 403 status code before running the tests.
   *
   * For continuous integration, you may want to use the `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI` option which does not
   * use an existing server on the CI. To see the stdout, you can set the `DEBUG=pw:webserver` environment variable.
   *
   * The `port` (but not the `url`) gets passed over to Playwright as a
   * [testOptions.baseURL](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-base-url). For example port
   * `8080` produces `baseURL` equal `http://localhost:8080`. If `webServer` is specified as an array, you must
   * explicitly configure the `baseURL` (even if it only has one entry).
   *
   * **NOTE** It is also recommended to specify
   * [testOptions.baseURL](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-base-url) in the config, so
   * that tests could use relative urls.
   *
   * **Usage**
   *
   * ```js
   * // playwright.config.ts
   * import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
   * export default defineConfig({
   *   webServer: {
   *     command: 'npm run start',
   *     url: 'http://localhost:3000',
   *     timeout: 120 * 1000,
   *     reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
   *   },
   *   use: {
   *     baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/',
   *   },
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Now you can use a relative path when navigating the page:
   *
   * ```js
   * // test.spec.ts
   * import { test } from '@playwright/test';
   *
   * test('test', async ({ page }) => {
   *   // This will result in http://localhost:3000/foo
   *   await page.goto('/foo');
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * Multiple web servers (or background processes) can be launched:
   *
   * ```js
   * // playwright.config.ts
   * import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
   * export default defineConfig({
   *   webServer: [
   *     {
   *       command: 'npm run start',
   *       url: 'http://localhost:3000',
   *       name: 'Frontend',
   *       timeout: 120 * 1000,
   *       reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
   *     },
   *     {
   *       command: 'npm run backend',
   *       url: 'http://localhost:3333',
   *       name: 'Backend',
   *       timeout: 120 * 1000,
   *       reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
   *     }
   *   ],
   *   use: {
   *     baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
   *   },
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * If your webserver runs on varying ports, use `wait` to capture the port:
   *
   * ```js
   * import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
   *
   * export default defineConfig({
   *   webServer: {
   *     command: 'npm run start',
   *     wait: {
   *       stdout: /Listening on port (?<my_server_port>\d+)/
   *     },
   *   },
   * });
   * ```

   * test.use({ baseUrl: `http://localhost:${process.env.MY_SERVER_PORT ?? 3000}` });

     * Configures the enclosing scope. Can be executed either on the top level or inside a describe. Configuration applies

     *
     * Learn more about the execution modes [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel).
     *
     * **Usage**
     * - Running tests in parallel.
     *

     *   test('runs in parallel 2', async ({ page }) => {});
     *   ```
     *
     * - Running tests in order, retrying each failed test independently.
     *
     *   This is the default mode. It can be useful to set it explicitly to override project configuration that uses
     *   `fullyParallel`.
     *
     *   ```js
     *   // Tests in this file run in order. Retries, if any, run independently.
     *   test.describe.configure({ mode: 'default' });
     *   test('runs first', async ({ page }) => {});
     *   test('runs second', async ({ page }) => {});
     *   ```
     *
     * - Running tests serially, retrying from the start. If one of the serial tests fails, all subsequent tests are
     *   skipped.
     *
     *   **NOTE** Running serially is not recommended. It is usually better to make your tests isolated, so they can be
     *   run independently.
     *
     *   ```js
     *   // Annotate tests as inter-dependent.
     *   test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' });
     *   test('runs first', async ({ page }) => {});
     *   test('runs second', async ({ page }) => {});
     *   ```
     *
     * - Configuring retries and timeout for each test.
     *
     *   ```js
     *   // Each test in the file will be retried twice and have a timeout of 20 seconds.
     *   test.describe.configure({ retries: 2, timeout: 20_000 });
     *   test('runs first', async ({ page }) => {});
     *   test('runs second', async ({ page }) => {});
     *   ```
     *
     * - Run multiple describes in parallel, but tests inside each describe in order.
     *
     *   ```js
     *   test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' });
     *

   * Skip a test. Playwright will not run the test past the `test.skip()` call.

   * [test.fixme([title, details, body, condition, callback, description])](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-fixme)
   * instead.
   *
   * To declare a skipped test:
   * - `test.skip(title, body)`
   * - `test.skip(title, details, body)`
   *
   * To skip a test at runtime:
   * - `test.skip(condition, description)`
   * - `test.skip(callback, description)`
   * - `test.skip()`
   *
   * **Usage**
   *

   *
   * test.skip('never run', async ({ page }) => {
   *   // ...

   * ```
   *
   * If your test should be skipped in some configurations, but not all, you can skip the test inside the test body
   * based on some condition. We recommend passing a `description` argument in this case. Playwright will run the test,
   * but abort it immediately after the `test.skip` call.
   *
   * ```js

     *
     * You can declare a test as failing, so that Playwright ensures it actually fails.
     *
     * ```js
     * import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
     *
     * test.fail('not yet ready', async ({ page }) => {
     *   // ...
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * If your test fails in some configurations, but not all, you can mark the test as failing inside the test body based
     * on some condition. We recommend passing a `description` argument in this case.
     *
     * ```js
     * import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
     *
     * test('fail in WebKit', async ({ page, browserName }) => {
     *   test.fail(browserName === 'webkit', 'This feature is not implemented for Mac yet');
     *   // ...
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * You can mark all tests in a file or
     * [test.describe([title, details, callback])](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe) group as
     * "should fail" based on some condition with a single `test.fail(callback, description)` call.
     *
     * ```js
     * import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
     *
     * test.fail(({ browserName }) => browserName === 'webkit', 'not implemented yet');
     *
     * test('fail in WebKit 1', async ({ page }) => {
     *   // ...
     * });
     * test('fail in WebKit 2', async ({ page }) => {
     *   // ...
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * You can also call `test.fail()` without arguments inside the test body to always mark the test as failed. We
     * recommend declaring a failing test with `test.fail(title, body)` instead.
     *
     * ```js
     * import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
     *
     * test('less readable', async ({ page }) => {
     *   test.fail();
     *   // ...

   * **Usage**

   * test('test', async ({ page }) => {

   * **Details**

   *   expect(user).toBe('john');
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * **Decorator**
   *
   * You can use TypeScript method decorators to turn a method into a step. Each call to the decorated method will show
   * up as a step in the report.
   *
   * ```js
   * function step(target: Function, context: ClassMethodDecoratorContext) {
   *   return function replacementMethod(...args: any) {
   *     const name = this.constructor.name + '.' + (context.name as string);
   *     return test.step(name, async () => {
   *       return await target.call(this, ...args);
   *     }, { box: true });
   *   };
   * }
   *
   * class LoginPage {
   *   constructor(readonly page: Page) {}
   *
   *   @step
   *   async login() {
   *     const account = { username: 'Alice', password: 's3cr3t' };
   *     await this.page.getByLabel('Username or email address').fill(account.username);
   *     await this.page.getByLabel('Password').fill(account.password);
   *     await this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
   *     await expect(this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'View profile and more' })).toBeVisible();
   *   }
   * }
   *
   * test('example', async ({ page }) => {
   *   const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
   *   await loginPage.login();
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * **Boxing**
   *
   * When something inside a step fails, you would usually see the error pointing to the exact action that failed. For
   * example, consider the following login step:
   *
   * ```js
   * async function login(page) {
   *   await test.step('login', async () => {
   *     const account = { username: 'Alice', password: 's3cr3t' };
   *     await page.getByLabel('Username or email address').fill(account.username);
   *     await page.getByLabel('Password').fill(account.password);
   *     await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
   *     await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'View profile and more' })).toBeVisible();
   *   });
   * }
   *
   * test('example', async ({ page }) => {
   *   await page.goto('https://github.com/login');
   *   await login(page);
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * ```txt
   * Error: Timed out 5000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()
   *   ... error details omitted ...
   *
   *    8 |     await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();
   * >  9 |     await expect(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'View profile and more' })).toBeVisible();
   *      |                                                                               ^
   *   10 |   });
   * ```
   *
   * As we see above, the test may fail with an error pointing inside the step. If you would like the error to highlight
   * the "login" step instead of its internals, use the `box` option. An error inside a boxed step points to the step
   * call site.
   *
   * ```js
   * async function login(page) {
   *   await test.step('login', async () => {
   *     // ...
   *   }, { box: true });  // Note the "box" option here.
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ```txt
   * Error: Timed out 5000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()
   *   ... error details omitted ...
   *
   *   14 |   await page.goto('https://github.com/login');
   * > 15 |   await login(page);
   *      |         ^
   *   16 | });
   * ```
   *

   *   return function replacementMethod(...args: any) {
   *     const name = this.constructor.name + '.' + (context.name as string);
   *     return test.step(name, async () => {
   *       return await target.call(this, ...args);

   *
   * **Details**
   *
   * When `expected` parameter is a string, Playwright will normalize whitespaces and line breaks both in the actual

   * 1. The matching subset of elements has the same order as the expected array.
   * 1. Each text value from the expected array is matched by some element from the list.
   *
   * For example, consider the following list:

   *
   * **Details**
   *
   * When `expected` parameter is a string, Playwright will normalize whitespaces and line breaks both in the actual
   * text and in the expected string before matching. When regular expression is used, the actual text is matched as is.
   *
   * **Usage**
   *
   * ```js
   * const locator = page.locator('.title');
   * await expect(locator).toHaveText(/Welcome, Test User/);
   * await expect(locator).toHaveText(/Welcome, .*\/);
   * ```
   *
   * If you pass an array as an expected value, the expectations are:
   * 1. Locator resolves to a list of elements.
   * 1. The number of elements equals the number of expected values in the array.
   * 1. Elements from the list have text matching expected array values, one by one, in order.
   *
   * For example, consider the following list:
   *
   * ```html
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Text 1</li>
   *   <li>Text 2</li>
   *   <li>Text 3</li>
   * </ul>
   * ```
   *
   * Let's see how we can use the assertion:
   *
   * ```js
   * // ✓ Has the right items in the right order
   * await expect(page.locator('ul > li')).toHaveText(['Text 1', 'Text 2', 'Text 3']);
   *
   * // ✖ Wrong order
   * await expect(page.locator('ul > li')).toHaveText(['Text 3', 'Text 2', 'Text 1']);
   *
   * // ✖ Last item does not match
   * await expect(page.locator('ul > li')).toHaveText(['Text 1', 'Text 2', 'Text']);
   *
   * // ✖ Locator points to the outer list element, not to the list items
   * await expect(page.locator('ul')).toHaveText(['Text 1', 'Text 2', 'Text 3']);
