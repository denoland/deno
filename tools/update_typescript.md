# Updating the version of TypeScript

This document provides an overview of how to update the version of TypeScript
that is built into the Deno CLI.

## Pre-flight checklist

- [ ] git and a local clone of this repository
- [ ] An npm package manager installed and available

## Background information

The TypeScript engine (`/cli/tsc/00_typescript.js`) provides type checking and
transformation services for the Deno CLI.

During the build (`/cli/build.rs`) the TypeScript engine, and integration code
(`/cli/tsc/99_main_compiler.js`) are loaded into a V8 isolate, which in turn
loads several of the baseline type libraries (`/cli/dts/*.d.ts`) as well as type
libraries provided by extensions (`/ext/*`). This isolate is then snapshotted
and included in the build of the CLI. This becomes the _COMPILER_ snapshot.

There are a few type libraries that are not loaded into the isolate, as they are
not "default" libraries at runtime, but we want to make them available to be
loaded dynamically for a user. They are built into the binary as text resources
during the build process.

Because Deno often supports web standards in advance of TypeScript supporting
them, we find ourselves in the undesirable situation of having to "patch" the
published type libraries included with TypeScript. Also, to allow TypeScript to
access any type libraries that aren't included with the distribution, we have to
patch the list in the TypeScript, so they are available to users.

While in theory a lot of this process could be automated, things can and do
change in both Deno and TypeScript, and often you don't know that they have
changed until you try to go through the process. Because updates to TypeScript
are relatively infrequent, and the process requires a decent amount of
contextual awareness, it is the author's opinion that it is best to spend the
10-15 minutes updating by hand to ensure that everything works as expected.

## Updating

1. If not present, create an empty npm project outside of the source tree of
   Deno. (e.g. `ts`, which will be used in this example).
2. Install the version of TypeScript you want to update to inside the empty
   project. (e.g. `npm i typescript@latest`).

   - TypeScript usually updates the `beta` and `rc` release tags as well, but
     you will want to check that, to make sure you are getting the version you
     expect.

3. Copy `ts/node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js` to
   `deno/cli/tsc/00_typescript.js`.
4. Copy `ts/node_modules/typescript/lib/*.d.ts` to `deno/cli/dts/`.
5. Delete `deno/cli/dts/protocol.d.ts`, `deno/cli/dts/tsserverlibrary.d.ts`,
   `deno/cli/dts/typescriptServices.d.ts` as they are not included in the CLI in
   any fashion.
6. Analyze the diff to `deno/cli/dts`:

   - A lot of the diff will be line termination differences which git will
     normalize when committed.
   - Notice any `lib.es*.d.ts` files that have been added. Yearly, TypeScript
     will usually add the new ES target in the first release post the new year.
     Also, as standards reach Stage 3, they usually get added to
     `lib.esnext.*.d.ts` files.
   - Remove any "dead" lib files. Currently TypeScript includes
     `lib.esnext.promise.d.ts`, `lib.esnext.string.d.ts`,
     `lib.esnext.weakref.d.ts` which contain definitions that were ratified and
     are now included in the other libs and aren't even referenced by
     `lib.esnext.d.ts` or within the TypeScript compiler. ðŸ¤·
   - Revert/merge any changes to lib files that provide forward support. This is
     the "hardest" thing, because you need to assess if the updated version of
     TypeScript now includes the type definitions that we forward support.
     Currently there the following:

     - `lib.esnext.array.d.ts` contains additional array APIs. These likely will
       be moved to ES2022 at some point, but currently only the
       `Array.prototype.at` has been added. You will likely need to revert the
       deletion of the lib from `lib.esnext.d.ts`.
     - We add `lib.dom.asynciterable.d.ts` because for some reason TypeScript
       has not built these into the libraries. (See:
       https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29867)
     - We add `lib.dom.extras.d.ts` because TypeScript is often behind
       supporting some DOM standards that Deno supports and when people use
       `lib: ["dom", "deno.ns"]` they will get error messages that are confusing
       when using libraries that take advantage of these standards. We add the
       library to `lib.dom.d.ts`, so it is automatically included when using the
       `dom` lib under Deno.
     - Response in cli/dts/lib.dom.d.ts gets an additional:
       `json(data: unknown, init?: ResponseInit): Response;`

7. Based on the changes to the lib files, you will need to edit the map of lib
   names to files in the TypeScript compiler (`deno/cli/tsc/00_typescript.js`).
   The map is currently named `libEntries` and will look a bit like this:

   ```js
   var libEntries = [
     // JavaScript only
     ["es5", "lib.es5.d.ts"],
     ["es6", "lib.es2015.d.ts"],
     ["es2015", "lib.es2015.d.ts"],
     ["es7", "lib.es2016.d.ts"],
     // ...
   ];
   ```

   You will want to make sure this matches what is on disk. TypeScript often
   maps `esnext.*` values to the ratified version of them to ensure they are
   less "breaking" so you will want to make sure, like for `esnext.array` that
   it points at `lib.esnext.array.d.ts`. You will also want to revert the
   deletion of `dom.asynciterable` and `dom.extras`.

8. For any new lib files that were added, but not included in the snapshot (e.g.
   `lib.es####.full.d.ts`) add them to `STATIC_ASSETS` in `deno/cli/tsc.rs`.
9. For any new lib files that will be loaded as part of the snapshot, (e.g.
   `lib.es####.d.ts`) add them to `libs` in `deno/cli/build.rs`.
10. For any APIs that we might have had forward support for but now are part of
    the libs, edit `deno/cli/tests/unit/esnext_test.ts` to remove the tests, so
    we are only testing our modifications.
11. Do a build and test for the changes. Specifically `esnext_test.ts` should
    pass and is an indicator that something isn't right.
12. Commit your changes and submit the PR.
13. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done.
